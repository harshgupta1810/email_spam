# Project Name: Spam Message Classification

## Project Description:
This project is a spam message classification model that aims to differentiate between spam and non-spam (ham) messages. The model is based on natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to predict whether a given message is spam or not. It can be used to identify and filter out unwanted spam messages, thus improving user experience and communication security.

## Installation:
1. Make sure you have Python 3.7 or later installed.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk wordcloud xgboost
   ```

## Usage:
1. Run the provided Python code in your preferred Python environment or IDE.
2. The code reads the data from "spam.csv" file, preprocesses the text data, and extracts relevant features for model training.
3. The spam message classification model is trained using various classifiers such as Gaussian Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Bagging, Extra Trees, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.
4. The model's accuracy and precision scores are displayed for each classifier, helping to evaluate their performance.

## Configuration:
There is no specific configuration required for this project. However, you can experiment with different classifiers or fine-tune hyperparameters in the model to achieve better performance.

## Contributing:
Contributions to this project are welcome. If you find any bugs or want to add new features, please follow these steps:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch with a descriptive name for your feature or bug fix.
3. Make your changes and test thoroughly.
4. Create a pull request to merge your changes into the main branch.
